        What is SportEth?
      </p>

      <p>
        SportEth is a platform for allowing people to bet on popular sports. The
        oracle is administered by SportEth token holders, and the book is funded
        by ethereum holders. They are paid via the 'vig' one sees in sport book
        odds. Bettors get quick and easy access to place bets.{" "}

        Do I have to use the SportEth.co front end?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        SportEth.co is all open source code that connects directly to the
        Ethereum blockchain. If one downloads the front-end from GitHub to one’s
        PC , you can avoid the website and run it locally. One can also access
        the contract via Remix, Web3.js, Truffle, etc.

        Why should we trust the Oracle?
      </p>

      <p>
        For the same reason you trust the Ethereum Blockchain: it’s uncensorable
        and its administrators make the most money acting honestly. Honest play
        for the oracle is more profitable and easier than dishonesty. A cheat
        would be easily observable in the price history of the Oracle that is
        easy to query. You should trust that it will report honestly because
        reporting true prices allows it to make more money, which is the best
        way to further whatever evil, benign, or salutary plans the Oracle has.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        All oracle actions--schedule, odds, results--are in easy-to-read event
        logs one can query on the website. A user who sees a bad price about to
        be applied to their weekly settlement has a 4 hour window to burn their
        PNL debit rather than send it to their counterparty, which is presumably
        a sock-puppet address of the oracle. While burning requires an
        out-of-pocket cost (it is a payable function), it is the optimal
        response because if you do not pay—burning the cheater’s payoff rather
        than sending it to him—the evil oracle will infer he can cheat you again
        next period by more than the cost of burning.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Given an investor would burn in a cheat and prevent the evil oracle a
        final period windfall, there is still a positive value to the strategy
        of entering a derivative contract and then walking away from a loss. For
        example, a simple cheat strategy would be to play until the evil oracle
        experienced a loss, and effectively walk-away from that final negative
        PNL. This simple strategy has a very limited expected value, about a
        1-standard deviation weekly PNL, but it is within 10% of the optimal
        risk-adjusted payout. Considering rational outsiders will avoid an
        easily observed cheating oracle, such a swindle is an exit scam.
      </p>

      <p>
        The optimal cheat return can be compared to the present value of future
        oracle revenue via closing fees, and the cost-benefit ratio for cheating
        is around 1:10, implying honesty is the Oracle's dominant selfish
        strategy.  This is discussed in more detail in the Technical Appendix.

        </span>
        This provides counterparties time to burn their PNL rather than send to
        an obviously evil Oracle. If the Oracle posts obviously fraudulent
        prices, any counterparty with more than ¼ of their margin over-funded
        will find it cheaper to burn than continue or default. This minimizes a
        potential Oracle exit scam payoff.

        This prevents a cheating Oracle/admin from sneaking a fraudulent
        settlement in at an unexpected time, such as at 2 AM Sunday. Such a
        scenario would allow an evil Oracle/admin to escape without
        counterparties having much time to burn their PNLs. It also prevents the
        scenario where an evil Oracle/admin might apply several fraudulent
        settlements quickly, effectively overcoming the RM cap on PNL.

        Oracle exit scam payoff (those counterparties who, for some reason,
        might not burn their PNL when cheated). No matter how much ETH is in a
        player’s margin, settlement can only transfer up to the RM regardless of
        asset price movement.

        What is a Swap?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hedge funds will often have ‘equity swap accounts’ with Prime Brokers
        who hold a basket of long and short equity positions that are
        marked-to-market daily and require a margin. They are called swap
        accounts because they swap the cashflows between the long and short
        holdings, though sometimes these swap accounts merely hold long or short
        positions. Each stock position in an equity swap is technically a
        Contract-for-Difference (CFD): it pays the difference in price for a
        reference asset times the number of shares held. CFD is an unnecessary
        acronym, so I prefer the term swap, as crypto traders should be familiar
        with it via BitMEX’s popular swap contracts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The long and short positions in an equity swap have funding rates based
        off of Fed Funds that is charged to the long positions and credited to
        the short. This funding cost is directly related to the basis (spot –
        futures) one sees in futures markets, in that as the futures price
        converges to the spot price at expiration, this amount can be converted
        to a rate. The many institutional constraints on arbitraging blockchain
        traded assets and contracts with those on traditional exchanges will
        create a significant basis outside of the mere effect from Fed Funds.
        That is, the inability of large investors arbitrage a large basis due to
        institutional rigidities allows the basis to deviate significantly from
        interest rates, so that the basis will be determined more by supply and
        demand.{" "}

      <p>Walking through the equation we have the following:</p>

      <p>
        <b>RM*LR</b>: notional of exposure in ETH due to Required Margin (RM)
        and Leverage Ratio (LR). Actual margin can be much higher than RM, so
        one’s actual leverage can always be lower than the LR.{" "}

        <b>
          *ETH<sub>t-1</sub>

        : This turns the ETH notional into the notional of the asset, valued at
        the beginning of the period. If the asset price is denominated in USD,
        the notional must be in USD, but if in ETH (as in the BTCETH contract),
        this adjustment is excluded. This implies the notional for USD
        denominated contracts will change over time as the price of ETH changes.
        If we were to have a constant USD or BTC notional, this would imply
        either a changing RM, or a changing volatility/RM, and this formulation
        is simpler.

        : This translates the PNL back into ETH at the end of the period for
        weekly settlement. Settlement is via ETH, so using the ETH price on both
        sides of the transaction effectively generates a linear return in the
        reference asset in its unit of denomination. If the ETH return
        abstracted from this currency adjustment it would create a complex
        adjustment term to preclude arbitrage, and be implicit within the basis.
        This term would involve the expected covariance of the ETH and asset
        price, which is a construct most investors neither understand nor want
        to.

        which can only happen at settlement, because players cannon withdraw
        their margin below their RM, so actual Margin can only fall below the RM
        via a PNL attribution, or if a Liquidity Provider (LP) a change in the
        net margin.{" "}

        For example, if the RM=10 and a player—LP or Taker—has 11 in their
        margin, an impending PNL= <span>-</span> 2 implies they need to add at
        least 1 ETH to their margin at settlement to avoid default. For an LP
        the situation is more complex, as an LP could have a balanced book with
        two takers with one long RM=100 the other short with RM=100. As the LP’s
        RM is netted it would have an RM=0 and could therefore be adequately
        margined at 0 ETH. In this case, if one taker cancelled, their new RM
        would be 100, and so while previous to settlement the LP could have an
        adequate margin whatever their Margin, it would need to make sure they
        had 100 ETH at settlement.{" "}

        How, Why, and When to Burn your PNL
      </p>

      <p>
        Burning one’s PNL requires a payment, but it saves the typical player
        from getting cheated in the next settlement. A clear cheat by the Oracle
        signals the Oracle is untrustworthy, and given its prices are easily
        observed, future players will be discouraged. Thus the cheating oracle
        has nothing to lose by cheating again and probably will. The value of
        this cheat will be greater than the cost of a burn, which can be deduced
        via the game theoretic concept of common knowledge. The self-interested
        rational response to a cheating oracle is to burn. There is no appeal to
        morality, retribution, or rehabilitation, just cold self-interest.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Given a cheater’s actions are easily observed and punishment is quick,
        it has the nice property of making sure even an evil oracle behave
        honestly in this contract (so it can make more money to fund other evil
        plans).

        Two parties to this contract need to be paid. The Liquidity Providers

        funding rate. This is different than most exchanges where the liquidity
        providers are called ‘market makers’, and have to also supply limit
        orders. The slow and expensive blockchain makes limit orders books
        infeasible, and so the LP gets no revenue via a bid-ask spread or maker
        rebate. This approach incentivizes the LP to keep their position open as
        long as possible.

        The target rate is to incent the LPs, while the basis rate is to
        equilibrate the long and short taker demand.  Takers pay the FR to the
        LPs, so the basis is a debit to longs, a credit to shorts.

      <p>
        There is no open fee. Closing a position, however, necessitate a 1.5% RM
        fee from the initiator of the close, which given leverage implies a
        0.15%, 0.60%, and 0.75% notional cost for SPX, BTC (both USD and ETH),
        and ETH contract respectively. This goes to the Oracle, as without such
        a payment it would lose nothing by destroying its reputation via
        dishonest reporting. For comparison, note these costs are the only ones
        applied round-trip, and there are no inexplicit costs via the bid-ask
        spread, price impact, having to move from one currency into another, or
        withdrawing money from the contract.

        When are Prices Taken?
      </p>

      <p>
        ETH and BTC prices use a couple minute window of prices from
        Bitwise-approved exchanges around 4 PM New York time, while the SPX
        Index price is recorded around 4:10 PM but refers to the 4 PM close (it
        is a composite of around 500 stock prices, so often is slightly adjusted
        from what is shows at 4:00 PM).  The crypto prices will have a standard
        error of about 0.1% when taken at the same time.

        Minimum Size
      </p>

      <p>
        10 ETH. All RM is in ETH integer amounts, though players can initialize
        a position by sending more than their RM

        LPs can set their own minimum size. As an LP’s book has a maximum number
        of takers at 80, this allows a large LP to post and not be constrained
        by small subcontracts, and also allowing smaller LPs to{" "}

        Maximum Take
      </p>

      <p>
        The LP provides ‘unsided’ offers, so she can post 100 ETH, but does not
        know whether it will initially be long or short. To prevent the case
        where she would get taken on 100 long, we limit a taker amount to that
        which would take he above 50% of her book given her current positions
        and open balance.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>The maximum amount a taker can take is as follows:</p>

      <p align="center">Max Long Take = ½ ExcessMargin + Short – Long </p>

      <p align="center">Max Short Take = ½ Excess Margin - Short + Long</p>

      <p>
        The maximum amount a taker can take is shown below. Note that the Excess
        Margin is just the Total minus Required margin.

        How to Withdraw
      </p>

      <p>
        For all players, taker or LP, removing ETH from either Margin or Open
        Balance in the same two-step process. First they withdraw to a Withdraw
        Balance, and then from their Withdrawal to their private address. This
        is to prevent re-entry attacks.
